The path of the equipment is presented in the form of a pixel matrix chart. The horizontal axis represents the space where the instrument is located, and the vertical axis represents time. In terms of space, the instrument will continuously travel between two or more spaces, including storage rooms, cleaning rooms, recycling rooms, and a total of 20 rooms with different functions. In terms of time, the selected time frame is from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with a 30-minute interval, totaling 20 time markers. As shown in  Fig. 1, an instrument enters the reception room at 10 a.m. for an hour. At eleven, it moves to a general consultation room, then travels back and forth between the storage room and the x-ray room, finally staying in the pharmacy room.
